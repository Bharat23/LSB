# LSBn 

LSB stands for Least Significant bit algorithm used for encrypting messages in images.
The code given here is used for the purpose of image steganography.
This is a modified LSB algorithm designed by me which uses the concept of just using the BLUE pixels to implement it.
Instructions of use :
1. Create a file named `input.txt` and write the text you want to hide inside the image
2. take care of the size of text as this method reduces the capacity of text bits it can accomodate
3. Take care of the name of the input image i.e. `2.png`
4. output image is saved in the same folder with the name `new2.png`
